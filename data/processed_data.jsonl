But make sure to check with your company's attorney because your ability to travel on your F-1 visa could be compromised if and when the H-1B petition is approved if approved as a change of status."}]}

The reasons cited are:<p>— The 10-day in-house job posting is of dubious quality now because there is no one at the office to to see it (it's closed and empty because of Covid), and they believe the Department of Labor may notice this and refuse applications.<p>— Because of the current administration's outlook on immigration, they're worried that more filings will be audited/rejected, which could lead to more oversight on future filings for the company, making things more difficult.<p>They said a number of times that pausing all PERMs is a proactive measure — there have been no issues so far, but they want to make sure there never are any.<p>The basic premises seem to make sense, but it puts all of us running through the process in a difficult position. They wouldn't give any timeline for how long such a pause would last, but reading between the lines with office closures, it seems that it would last at least all of 2020, and probably well into 2021.<p>My question: Is what my company doing reasonable, or is it more of a situation where they're adopting a very conservative stance to reduce their own risk down to zero, even at the cost of putting all its employees into immigration limbo?<p>Thanks!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Really both.  First, your company can post the notice of filing electronically so that's not a real issue.

I'd say the approach is similar to finding people in other professional fields. Ask someone you know and trust in the legal field for a recommendation for someone in a specialty.

If they do, they should be able to visit you without issue.  If they don't, they would need to apply for visas and that adds a layer of uncertainty - their visa applications could be denied.  Between B-2 and F-1 visas, there's a greater likelihood that their F-1 visa applications would be denied. But, with some planning, you might be able to minimize these issues.

My partner is on a cap-exempt H1B (academia) and is a citizen of a European country. She has her work authorization, but the visa in her passport is expired, and to my understanding she needs that to re-enter the U.S. should she leave the country. As you know, visas are not being issued until at least Dec. 31st by presidential proclamation. After that, it seems consulates have a huge backlog of visas to issue, so assuming the proclamation is not extended, it seems the time-limiting step will be getting an appointment. It is our understanding that until then, she cannot leave the country without risking her employment, as she may be unable to return to the U.S. for six months or more (which violates the conditions of the H1B).<p>I have two questions:<p>1. Is our information correct? We have found conflicting information from \"official\" sources (universities, lawyers, ...)<p>2. I understand the desire to prevent abuse of the H1B system.

My wife of 12 years is Russian and has had a green card since 2000. She grew up in New York. She came here with me for my work, and due to COVID was unable to return to the US to renew her green card before it expired in April.<p>The company I work for is being acquired, and we are preparing to move back to the US. The consulate here said that because she has been away for more than a year, and because \"staying with my US husband who was working for a US company in Chile\" doesn't count as extenuating circumstances, her LPR status no longer applies, and she has to refile the IR1 from zero.<p>We've started that process, but having to stay in Chile for another 12+ months while they sort it out is at odds with needing to return to the US and perform my job for the new company. The consulate here isn't very friendly towards her (literally telling her she could have just divorced me and moved back to the US if she wanted to remain an LPR). We didn't have a problem returning after we lived in Poland for 3 years from 2008-2011 (also for my work), and your statement of, \"...and even there really isn't a restriction...\" caught my attention.<p>Is there some magic incantation or specific words she can say to the consulate here to grant her permission to return with me to the US and get her green card reinstated from within the US? My employer is being super cool about this, but it's clear that my role (Director of Community and Evangelism) will be executed better from _within_ the US.<p>If this constitutes legal advice you can't give in this forum, I'm perfectly willing to retain you to discuss it further. We're literally sitting in our house in Chile, bags packed, movers on standby, waiting for them to say she can return to the country where she's lived since she was 9."},{"role":"assistant","content":"The Embassy in Chile is clearly acting badly. So far it appears that you have received an informal opinion from the Embassy but there is a formal process under these circumstances that would reaffirm her green card status and allow her to travel back to the US. The document is called a returning resident visa and it probably makes sense or her to apply for this and force the Embassy to review the evidence and make a real decision. She should consult with an immigration attorney, however, possibly the immigration attorney for your employer, to help her with this application."}]}

I've built sophisticated logistics tools that generated $500k+ of annual recurring revenue in my role as a software engineer. The startup I'm working is launching soon and will be a B2B SaaS that should generate good cash flow. For who have been through similar situations or with immigration knowledge, your feedback and advice would be greatly appreciated:\n1. What are my best options for staying in the US?<p>2. What other options do I have for staying in the US?<p>3. For an H1B visa, is there any downside to applying through multiple employers for different positions at different companies?<p>4.

Thanks!<p>Say a US employer has about 1000 employees who are all residing in the US (so payroll is only set up to handle US taxes and so forth) because it was all commuters until the pandemic.

No problem.<p>When a remote employee says they're starting the process of moving to Canada and obtaining Canadian citizenship and prefers to keep their current job, how much effort goes into achieving that on the employer's side?

The visa classifications that give spouses (and only married spouses can get dependent visas under U.S. immigration law; common-law spouses can't) unrestricted work authorization are the E-1 and E-2 visas, the E-3 visa, and the L-1 visa.

I work remotely and hence have worked through a limited company.

What is the easiest/quickest route for an L1-B visa holder to get a green card?<p>Huge thanks"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1) No, unfortunately.\n2) Green card options aren't tied to or dependent on in any way the individual's nonimmigrant status so your possible options are the same whether you are in L-1B, H-1B, O-1, etc.  It's just coincidental - not causal - that those in a certain nonimmigrant status go down a certain green card path.

Given your skills, one of you should be able to get one (and the other can come as a spouse and apply for a work permit with the right visa type). After a few years with that, you can apply for a green card (permanent resident status). I know people who have renewed those for decades without becoming citizens. Or, after a few years with the green card, you can apply for citizenship.<p>I know lots of Brits and Canadians in California who have also followed this path.<p>A lot of talk in here about H1B visas, and that's probably because they're the most plentiful. But, that's not the only type of visa that people should be thinking about."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Thanks for the response. Yes, there are other options that aren't subject to the crazy and uncertain H-1B lottery such as the O-1 visa (which, without knowing more, you both probably would qualify for).

I'm reading that 40% of H1Bs were RFEd in fiscal year 2019 under Trump, versus 16% under Biden in 2021 [1]. I was personally affected by this: both of my H-1B petitions were RFE'd under Trump (I have a math PhD from a top 20 American university and am working in software). These RFEs are incredibly stressful, time consuming and costly for companies.<p>- During the Trump administration, USCIS started requiring almost all employment-based green card applicants to attend an interview. This significantly slows down the green card application process because USCIS is bottlenecked on officers to perform interviews. Biden reverted this change.<p>- During FY2022, due to the dynamics of US immigration law, nearly double the number of employment-based green cards were available than usual (265k versus 140k normally). Under Biden USCIS basically had a task force actively dedicated to ensuring all of these green cards were used [2]. I think we can pretty sure that under Trump, USCIS would have had a business-as-usual attitude, not deployed any special measures, and would only have issued around the regular quota of visas.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://resources.envoyglobal.com/global-immigration-compass/h-1b-requests-for-evidence-explained/#:~:text=USCIS%20data%20indicates%20that%20the,to%2012.1%25%20in%20September%202021\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://resources.envoyglobal.com/global-immigration-compass...</a>.\n[2] <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/archive/fiscal-year-2022-employment-based-adjustment-of-status-faqs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.uscis.gov/archive/fiscal-year-2022-employment-ba...</a>"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Another very concrete example, during the Trump administration, USCIS revoked it's long standing policy of giving deference to previously approved H-1B petitions when adjudicating extension petitions with the same employer.

Any angle to work around it?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Good question. Separate income streams are complicated.  A concurrent part-time H-1B is sometimes an option for other employment.  The problem with this specific situation is that a concurrent part-time H-1B would have to be structured, at least in part, as paid employment."}]}

Thank you for your time."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hey. Probably the best way is to go to university in the U.S. on an F-1 visa.  The challenge is the strict limitations on working when attending school but after you graduate, you will get 1-3 years of largely unrestricted work authorization and the TN as a work option as well.  Or go to university in Canada and then when you graduate, work in the U.S. on a TN."}]}

Specifically, if I have a tech company set up in the US that's pulling some decent revenue, is it worth applying for an O1? What other circumstances come into play against/in favor of this?<p>I've seen a lot of advisors and \"influencers\" all over the web saying that it's \"easy\". I don't think that's the case because nothing in US immigration is easy, unless your net worth is like 9 figures, maybe; but if it's not that far-fetched I may consider applying for one.<p>Alternatively, could one sponsor its own H1B visa? I guess the actual underlying question is: if I'm an entrepreneur with a real, solid company based in the US (but I'm not in the US and not a US citizen), what is the best way for me to move there and keep working at my company?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I wouldn't characterize an O-1 as easy but it's often within reach of talented professionals, particularly founders. At the end of the day, the issue is less about the quality of the evidence - although that matters - and more about the existence of evidence that checks at least 3 boxes/criteria. And now, with the recent public announcements from the Administration, O-1 petitions with an AI component have an even greater chance of approval."}]}

I'm struggling with my immigration status and my friend recommended my to ask on this website. I hope I can get some legal advice well!<p>My current immigration status\n: I came to USA a year ago with J1 internship visa (2years requirement waiver). At first I had no plan for marriage. But, July 2023, I suddenly got married with my boyfriend. I quit my job and moved to the another state where he is living, so my J1 visa was expired around Sep-Oct 2023. We started living together since Sep 2023, and we filed I-130, I-485, I-765, I-131 soon. I got receipt notices for them around the end of Sep 2023. I received my EAD card last year as well.\n>>> Entry visa: J1 internship without 2 years requirement. - Now expired.\n>>> Current status: I-130, I-485, I-131 pending. I received EAD card. I sent medical examination result (I 693) already. I went for a biometrics appointment and submitted my finger print as well.<p>However, Feb 2024, something happened and I reported my husband to local police and military police since he is a military active duty. I reported for domestic violence(sexual, verbal, emotional, mental). Military issued No Contact order on him on Feb 2024 and it's still valid. I don't have Protection Order from court. I have my victim advocate on military base and military victim attorney as well.<p>>>> I have my local police report/ military police report/ no contact order from military/ no contact order extension from military/ counseling record regarding Sexual assault and emotional abuse (This counseling was done Nov 2023, Dec 2023)/ Statement of my friend as a witness(She didn't see it, but I told her about Sexual Assault when that happened)/ Therapist letter - asking extension of no contact order after the incident/ Psychiatrist letter - after incident I got diagnosed PTSD, Anxiety disorder & Insomnia/ ER visit paper after the incident (panic attack & anxiety)/ Statement of victim advocate/ military victim attorney contract paper/ Text message screenshot - my husband was admitting his behavior (Suicidal threat with knife to his throat& Verbal rape threat)<p>Since Mar 2024, I relocated myself to another state and currently I'm staying at domestic violence victim shelter. He filed a divorce paper around end of Feb or early March of 2023. Our divorce will be finalized maybe next week(probably- by 04/20/2024)<p>Now, I'm trying to apply for VAWA green card. \nMy previous immigration attorney told me that my husband has withdrawn I-130 and I-485. She didn't inform me before I asked her the other day- saying she doesn't represent any of us, due too conflict interest. I guess my husband withdrew my petitions a while ago, but I could know this information the other day.\nHowever, whenever I check my case status on USCIS website with receipt numbers,  \nit doesn't say my cases are withdrawn. It just says 'We sent you receipt notice'\n>>> So, my understanding of this situation is - He filed a withdrawal paper but it's still processing. So my petitions are still pending.<p>I'm desperately looking for proper immigration legal advice. I'm talking to some legal aid associations but they don't respond me promptly, it seems that I'm on the waiting list. I want to get some legal advice and do this process by myself.<p>>>>Here's my questions.<p>1. How can I check if the withdrawal paper is submitted? Even if it's submitted, when I put my receipt number on USCIS, it doesn't say it's withdrawn - that means my petitions are still pending?<p>2. For VAWA process, are these only forms that I have to apply for?\n(I 360, I 485, I 131, I 693, I 765)<p>>> Do I have to submit withdrawal form for pending petitions before I submit new petitions? (I 130, I 485, I 131) \n>> Is there any way to keep my current I 485, I 131 pending petitions? Or do I need to submit new forms for same petitions?\n>> After finalization of divorce, will my current pending petitions be automatically withdrawn? (I 130, I 485, I 131)<p>>> Let's say our divorce is finalized on 04/18/2024, then if I submit VAWA green card application and receive receipt notice around 05/10/2024 \n1) does that mean I'm staying in US illegally for a few weeks? \n2) In the meantime (04/18/2024 - 05/10 /2024), can I work with my EAD card legally? (My main concern)\n3) Will it be a problem with my green card approval? Can it be considered as residing in the states illegally? Is there a possibility that they can deport me?<p>** Especially, I have a big concern with my EAD card.. I have a job interview soon and I'm so worried if I can't legally work anymore after divorce<p>>> I already receive my EAD card, and it's valid until 2028. Do I need to submit new I 765 form?<p>>> Apparently my husband already filed a withdrawal paper for I 130, I 485. So,, if that's approved around May 2024, does that indicate of the termination of EAD card?<p>>> After the finalization of divorce, can I still use my EAD card and legally work? or will it be invalid automatically?<p>>> Will my EAD card be still valid even after I submit new I 765 form?<p>I'd like to know if I can legally work after divorce since this EAD card is based on his I-130 petition as far as I know. Also, I'm so confused if I have to file a new I 765 even after I received it already. If I have to submit new I 765, does than mean the termination of my current EAD card?<p>Also, I have last question.\nI'm talking to one immigration attorney from the legal aid based on different state with my current address. I was already talking to him before I relocated myself and still. He recommended me to find new legal aid in this area, and I tried several times but it's really hard to find. I want to suggest him to go through this VAWA process together. I'm wondering if that can be possible - The attorney is in Western part of the country and I'm in Eastern. Can he work with me for the VAWA process and file the form to the nearest USCIS from my current address?<p>Thanks for your time.\nI think my situation is a bit complicated, I'm so confused what I have to do. Especially, about EAD card, I have so much concern since I have a job interview soon. \nI hope to hear from you soon. Have a good evening!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You need to speak with an immigration lawyer who specializes in VAWA. If you email me, I can refer some to you."}]}

If the individual is not employed by a related entity abroad, then other options must be considered.  First, there are easy options if the individual is a citizen of one of five countries with its own visa; these are Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Singapore.  These countries have free trade agreements with the U.S. that give rise to these visas.  If the individual is not a citizen of one of these countries but is employed in H-1B status by another company (or previously was employed in H-1B status), then an H-1B change of employer application is usually the best option and an easy one.  If the individual is not employed in H-1B status (and never has been), then we look at the O-1.  Sometimes the E-1 or E-2 visa is an option but this has very specific and limited requirements regarding the nationality of the company and the individual and regarding the company's trade with U.S. and investment into the U.S. company.

And most of the damage was done to those who were illegal or seeking asylum or were from certain countries and seeking to travel to the U.S.  It was awful and very disruptive to the lives of many.  On the legal business immigration side, the main damage was the result of changes in policy and the way regulations were interpreted and applied.  This included doing away with the deference given to previously approved applications when extensions/renewals were sought.  This was disastrous, resulting in the denial of applications for people who had been employed in the U.S. by the same employer for years. The Biden administration immediately undid this when it took office.  The other major change was in changing/increasing the requirements for getting H-1B and O-1 visas and extraordinary ability green cards.

In other words, there are no easy solutions for Russian citizens unless they are seeking to travel to the U.S. on government business or possibly seeking to travel to the U.S. to create jobs.

The other option is the E-1 treaty trader visa, which doesn't require any minimum investment but instead requires the existence of substantial trade between the U.S. and the E-2 applicant's country of nationality so this is usually an option for more mature companies.

This is done all the time but to be clear, it usually doesn't help but there's really nothing else to do. In the non-tourist visa application context, some people file mandamus actions, which oftentimes help but I think such an action would just accelerate the denial of the visitor visa application."}]}

I'm planning to apply for my citizenship this summer. Do you think there would be any complications with my naturalization given the current political climate and that Trump's now in office? Since my green card is also expiring around that time, would you recommend that I request its renewal separately or would I be fine waiting to apply for citizenship right away?<p>2. After obtaining my citizenship, I'm also planning to petition a visa for my fiancé (which is also an Iranian living inside Iran). Do you think that request would still be processed same as before during this new administration? Would requesting for a spouse visa be any better if we were to get married sooner?<p>3. Would it be any better if my fiancé were to apply for a college/university in the US instead? I'm asking this because I've heard rumors that Trump would be much easier on student visas than immigration visas."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1. I would recommend applying to renew your green card as well because it's not clear how long the naturalization process will take under the new administration. Regarding potential complications, last time he was in office, I didn't see any extra issues/delays with my Iranian clients becoming citizens.\n2. This process could be impacted because she's outside the U.S. and it's easier for the administration to impact those outside the U.S. seeking immigrant (green card) visas through a U.S. Consulate than to impact those in the U.S. seeking to obtain green cards through USCIS. I don't think it matters whether you get married sooner.\n3. Possibly but as you know, even Iranians applying for F-1 students visas can be subject to significant delays."}]}

The main advantages of the H-1B relative to the L-1 is that it's transferable from one company to another and can be renewed indefinitely if you are in the green card process.

Despite this, the current climate often unfairly associates undocumented immigrants with criminal activity. How can someone in this situation avoid being wrongfully labeled as a “criminal immigrant,” especially in the event of an ICE raid?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Sometimes there are employment-based green card paths that can help for those seeking asylum but whether going down this path would allow you to travel would depend in part on your immigration history - what your status was when you came to the U.S., when you/your parents applied for asylum, etc. If you haven't already, you should speak with an immigration attorney to look at all options, including those based on employment."}]}

However, I did get married to a US Citizen and am also applying for my green card via marriage. I need to move to the E3 as my H1B maxes out before I can get a green card. I have a few questions:<p>* The E3 visa is a non-immigrant visa, but I assume getting married to a US citizen implies immigrant intent. My lawyers tell me it's not an issue as long as I wait 90 days after getting the E3 to apply for the green card. Does that sound right / any concerns?<p>* How long are you seeing current wait times for the marriage based green card end to end after applying? I'm mostly concerned about not being able to leave the country for 1-2 years (even with filing advanced parole)<p>* I'm also going for the employment based green card and we've filed my PERM (3 months ago). That doesn't really seem like it;s going to work out in time for it to matter. Does that sound right?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"My responses in order:\n1. The safest advice is to wait at least 90 days after entering the U.S. before applying for a green card; however, applying for an E-3 visa after getting married to a U.S. citizen involves some risk. If you are in the U.S. and just changing your status to E-3 from H-1B (and not applying for an E-3 visa), then you really don't have to wait the 90 days.\n2. Until January 20th, less than 6 months typically although there was variation depending on place of residence. It appears, however, that USCIS is bringing back the in-person interview as part of the marriage-based green card application process and this will slow the process down considerably to what it was before, which was one to two years.\n3. Absolutely; the marriage-based route should be much faster."}]}

IANAL so do your own homework. However, I have been on TN visas for almost a decade.<p>1. Once you enter the US on a work visa, you are only authorized to work under the restrictions of that visa which are normally tied to a single employer. The \"I was working remotely for a Canadian corp\" does not fly legally speaking. Wherever your feet are are \"where\" you are working. That being said, one little known thing about the TN visa is that you are allowed to have multiple of them issued for multiple employers. If you get one from all of your clients, you can continue working for those clients while you are in the US. Practically speaking, they cannot tell you are working remotely and your clients are sending payment to the Canadian corp. However, if audited, do not expect to ever be allowed back into the US.<p>2. Anyone can start an LLC. You do not need a work visa. However, if you do not have work authorization to work for that company, then you cannot legally work on that business.<p>3. This is going to be a matter of preference and what you classify as flexible. TN visas are very convenient and issued at the port-of-entry which makes them quick to process. They are also indefinitely renewable and multiple can be issued for multiple employers. The other visas you mention will take months to process. The rules to transition to E-2 are clear \"If the treaty investor is currently in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status, they may file Form I-129 to request a change of status to E-2 classification.\"<p>4. Consulting is one of the most scrutinized jobs under the TN classification. I do not like being the bearer of bad news but obtaining a Green Card is now a 5+ year process unless you qualify for EB-1 or marry a US citizen which you can get right away. However, you probably do not qualify based on the fact you are focused on consulting. I am not an expert on E-2 visas so I don't know how consulting is treated under that visa but it may very well be your best bet."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Excellent responses.  Thank you.  I would add that the O-1 and the E-2 are probably the best fits to do consulting work for multiple companies in the U.S. but the O-1 requires a relatively high level of achievement and the E-2 requires a \"substantial\" investment by (in this case) Canadian citizens (which can include investments by you) or Canadian-owned companies and a business plan that shows the hiring of U.S. workers (citizens and permanent residents) over time."}]}

I'm not sure how long it would take for the U.S. to get out of  the free trade agreement but if the U.S. were so motivated, it effectively could kill the TN very quickly, even if just by policy and practice.

Green card applications are prospective in nature, meaning they concern what the applicant will do after getting a green card so what an applicant is doing now, before getting a green card, shouldn't matter strictly speaking but switching to H-4 and stopping work could cause USCIS to question whether you intend to work in your EB-1A field after getting your green card. To be clear, however, the risk of this is low and USCIS's concern if raised easily rebutted.\n2. Yes but you would need the original receipt or approval notice (combined with your existing visa) to get back in. Make sure to speak with the company's attorney about this/travel.\n3. Unlikely, since the EB-1A isn't based on a specific offer of employment but as noted above, a change to a different field could raise questions about whether you will continue to work in your EB-1A field after getting your green card. To be clear, however, the risk is low that a job change in the EB-1A context would trigger an RFE by USCIS."}]}
